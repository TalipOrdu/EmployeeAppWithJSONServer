# EmployeeAppWithJSONServer
I created a Employee Page with Html Bootstrap And Javascript. I set up Webpack server and used port 3200.
After that created a fake employee data in json format. All employees data keep in JSON server in port 3000.
Then wrote Employee Adding, Updating and Deleting. All js file gathered in one file, mean is bundle.js
